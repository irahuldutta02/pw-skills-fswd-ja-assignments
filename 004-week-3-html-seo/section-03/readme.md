### Question No: 5
`Answer:`
**Favicon** is a small icon that represents a website or web page and is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, bookmarks, and tabs. It helps users visually identify and differentiate websites. Favicon files are usually in .ico format but can also be in .png or .jpg formats.

Illustrative Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, a favicon with the file name "favicon.ico" is linked to the website using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. This favicon will be displayed in the browser's tab when users visit the website.
