1. **Semantic Elements:** HTML5 introduced semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside>`, making it easier to structure web content meaningfully.

2. **Audio and Video Support:** HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content with the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, reducing the reliance on third-party plugins like Flash.

3. **Canvas:** The `<canvas>` element allows for dynamic rendering of graphics, charts, and animations directly within the browser.

4. **Local Storage:** HTML5 provides a way to store data locally in the user's browser using the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs, reducing the need for cookies.

5. **Geolocation:** HTML5 allows websites to access the user's geographical location through the Geolocation API.

6. **Form Enhancements:** New input types such as `<input type="email">` and `<input type="date">` improve form validation and user experience.

7. **Web Workers:** Web Workers enable multi-threading in web applications, improving performance by running scripts in the background.

2. `&gt;` - Represents the greater-than sign (>).
3. `&amp;` - Represents the ampersand (&).

Accessibility in web development refers to designing and developing websites and web applications in a way that ensures they are usable and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. It is essential to create accessible websites for several reasons:

**1. Inclusivity:** Accessible websites ensure that people with disabilities can access and interact with web content, promoting inclusivity and equal access to information and services.

**2. Legal Compliance:** Many countries have laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States, that require websites to be accessible. Non-compliance can result in legal issues and penalties.

**3. Enhanced User Experience:** Accessibility features, such as clear navigation, proper headings, and alt text for images, benefit all users by improving overall usability and user experience.

**4. Expanded Audience:** Making websites accessible can expand the potential audience, including individuals with disabilities who might otherwise be excluded from using the site.

**5. Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Some accessibility practices, such as using descriptive text for images, can improve a website's SEO and search engine rankings.

**6. Reputation and Brand Image:** Creating accessible websites demonstrates a commitment to diversity and inclusivity, which can enhance a company's reputation and brand image.

Accessible websites benefit different user groups, including:

- **Visually Impaired Users:** Screen readers and Braille displays can interpret accessible web content, allowing blind or visually impaired users to navigate and understand websites.

- **Hearing Impaired Users:** Captions and transcripts for audio and video content make it accessible to users with hearing impairments.

- **Motor Impaired Users:** Keyboard navigation and reduced reliance on mouse interactions accommodate users with motor impairments.

- **Cognitive and Learning Disabilities:** Clear and concise content, consistent navigation, and easy-to-understand language benefit users with cognitive and learning disabilities.

### Question No: 4
`Answer:`
Three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML are:

1. **Use Semantic HTML Elements:** Use semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to provide meaningful structure to your web content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret the content correctly.

2. **Provide Alt Text for Images:** Always include descriptive alt text for images using the `alt` attribute in `<img>` elements. Alt text should convey the content and purpose of the image, making it accessible to visually impaired users.

3. **Implement Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that all interactive elements on your website can be navigated and activated using a keyboard alone. Test the tab order and make sure it follows a logical sequence.
