The purpose of comments in HTML is to add notes or descriptions within the HTML code that are not displayed by the browser. Comments allow developers to leave explanatory notes for other developers or themselves to understand the structure and logic of the HTML code.

Here is an example of how to use comments in HTML:

```html
<!-- This is a comment in HTML -->

<h1>Hello World</h1>

<!-- This heading tag displays "Hello World" text on the page -->
```

In the above example, the text within the <!-- --> tags is comment text that the browser will ignore when rendering the page. The comments explain the purpose of the heading tag below it.

Comments are especially useful when working with complex web pages and templates to indicate sections of code or leave notes for other developers. They allow adding contextual information without impacting what displays to the end user.
